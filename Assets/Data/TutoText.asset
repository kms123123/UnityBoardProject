  player1Text: "The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections, or points.
    \nEach player has nine pieces, or men.\nPlayers try to form 'mills'\u2014three
    of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\u2014\nallowing a player to
    remove an opponent's man from the game.\nA player wins by reducing the opponent
    to two men \n(whereupon they can no longer form mills and thus are unable to
    win), \nby leaving them without a legal move, \nor by making your opponent take
    10 turns in FLYING phase. \r\n\r\nThe game proceeds in three phases:\r\n\r\n1.
    Placing men on vacant points\r\n2. Moving men to adjacent points\r\n3. Moving
    men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three "
  player2Text: "Phase 1: Placing pieces\r\n\r\nNine men's morris starts on an empty
    board.\r\nThe game begins with an empty board. \nThe players determine who plays
    first and then take turns.\nDuring the first phase, a player's turn consists
    of placing a man from their hand onto an empty point. \nIf a player is able to
    place three of their pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically
    or horizontally, \nthey have formed a mill, which allows them to remove one of
    their opponent's pieces from the board. \nA piece in an opponent's mill, however,
    can be removed only if no other pieces are available. \nAfter all men have been
    placed, phase two begins."
  AIText: "Phase 2: Moving pieces\r\n\nPlayers continue to alternate moves, this
    time moving one of their men to an adjacent point each turn.\nPlayers continue
    to try to form mills and remove their opponent's pieces as in phase one. \nIf
    all a player's pieces get blocked in, \n(where they are unable to move to an
    adjacent, empty space) that player loses. \nWhen one player has been reduced
    to three men, phase three begins."
  myText: "Phase 3: Flying\n\nWhen a player is reduced to three pieces, there is
    no longer a limitation on that player \nof moving to only adjacent points: \nThe
    player's men may \"fly\" (or \"hop\", or \"jump\") from any point to any vacant
    point.\r"
